# medical-assistant-chatbot
An Artificially Intelligent Medical Assistant Chat Bot using Python and deep learning algorithoms were used for the creation of realistic-sounding conversations.

Concepts from natural language processing, deep learning, and neural networks were used in this project.

A GUI is used to display the input and the output of the program.

The GUI is designed to look like a typical messaging app using in social media.

# Design Process and Methods
The chatbot is divided into five python files. Each python file performs a task that is essential for the bot to work. In this report, the five python files are going to be categorized and explained in their respective category. The categories are as follows: training, processing, and graphic user interface. The python files that handle the training of the dataset are nnModel.py, stem.py, and training.py. The python file that handles the processing of data is predict.py and the python file that handles the graphical user interface is gui.py. All of these files will be explored in more details throughout the report. For our dataset, we chose to create our own data and it was saved in intents.json.
